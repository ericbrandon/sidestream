      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>What are API keys?</h2>
        <p>If you have an account with Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google Gemini you can get a code called an API key to use their AI services on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p>
        <p>They'll need a credit card so they can bill you for your AI usage.</p>
        <p>Your billing relationship is between you and the AI companies, not this app which is free.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>Where do I get API keys?</h2>
        <p>Once you have an account with these companies you can set up an API key at:</p>
        <ul class="api-links">
          <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> - Get your key at <a href="https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console.anthropic.com/settings/keys</a></li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> - Get your key at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys</a></li>
          <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> - Get your key at <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys</a></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>What are the benefits of an API key vs a subscription?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>With an API key you pay only for what you use. If you don't use AI this month, you pay nothing.</li>
          <li>With an API key there are no usage limits.</li>
          <li>You probably wouldn't want to subscribe to three different AI companies, but with API keys you can use the latest, best models from all three companies that free users don't have access to.</li>
          <li>You can mix and match - have a subscription to one or more AI company, but also have API keys for when you hit usage limits, or want to use a different company's models.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>What are the drawbacks of API keys?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>If you're a light user you'll probably save money with API keys vs. subscriptions, but if you're a moderate to heavy user API usage will end up being more expensive than a subscription.</li>
          <li>Additionally, this app uses more AI than a regular AI chat app because of the additional search & AI that happens in the discovery panel. So this app is not for the cost-conscious.  It's for people who want the most useful & interesting AI chat experience.</li>
          <li>While this app has a lot of features, there are features such as persistent memory across chats, Anthropic "artifacts", and more that this app doesn't yet have. If those features are key to you, you may need to use the AI companies' own apps as well.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>Which API keys should I get?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Because they don't cost anything if you don't use them, we recommend getting all three API keys because that gives you maximum flexibility and best results when using this app.</li>
          <li>If you want to get only one, we recommend Anthropic.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section class="api-section">
        <h2>How do I monitor my API usage spending?</h2>
        <p>You can track the spending at these links:</p>
        <ul class="api-links">
          <li><strong>Anthropic</strong> - <a href="https://console.anthropic.com/settings/cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console.anthropic.com/settings/cost</a></li>
          <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> - <a href="https://platform.openai.com/usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform.openai.com/usage</a></li>
